Hooks for the component
constructor
This is invoked when Angular creates a component or directive by calling new on the class.

ngOnChanges
Invoked every time there is a change in one of th input properties of the component.

ngOnInit
Invoked when given component has been initialized.
This hook is only called once after the first ngOnChanges

ngDoCheck
Invoked when the change detector of the given component is invoked. It allows us to implement our own change detection algorithm for the given component.

Important
ngDoCheck and ngOnChanges should not be implemented together on the same component.
Note
We will cover this hook in more detail in the Advanced Components section at the end of this course.
ngOnDestroy
This method will be invoked just before Angular destroys the component.
Use this hook to unsubscribe observables and detach event handlers to avoid memory leaks.

Hooks for the components children
These hooks are only called for components and not directives.

Note
We will cover the difference between Components and Directives in the next section.
ngAfterContentInit
Invoked after Angular performs any content projection into the components view (see the previous lecture on Content Projection for more info).

ngAfterContentChecked
Invoked each time the content of the given component has been checked by the change detection mechanism of Angular.

ngAfterViewInit
Invoked when the componentâ€™s view has been fully initialized.

ngAfterViewChecked
Invoked each time the view of the given component has been checked by the change detection mechanism of Angular.
