---Functional Programming: Remove Elements from an Array Using slice Instead of splice---
when you want to remove items and keep the rest of the array. JavaScript offers the splice method for this, which takes arguments for the index of where to start removing items, then the number of items to remove. If the second argument is not provided, the default is to remove items through the end. However, the splice method mutates the original array it is called on.
---Concat offers a way to add new items to the end of an array without any mutating side effects.--

---The variable watchList holds an array of objects with information on several movies. Use reduce to find the average IMDB rating of the movies directed by Christopher Nolan.--
    var listOfMovies = watchList.filter(item=>item.Director === "Christopher Nolan")
var averageRating = listOfMovies.map(item=>item.imdbRating).reduce((a,b)=> parseFloat(a)+parseFloat(b))/listOfMovies.length;

---Functional Programming: Sort an Array Alphabetically using the sort Method--
    arr.sort((a,b)=>a>b)
