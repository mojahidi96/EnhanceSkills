V8 is Googleâ€™s open source high-performance JavaScript and WebAssembly engine, written in C++.
It is used in Google Chrome, the open source browser from Google, and in Node.js, among others.

 It implements ECMAScript and WebAssembly, and runs on Windows 7 or later, macOS 10.12+, 
 and Linux systems that use x64, IA-32, ARM, or MIPS processors. V8 can run standalone, or can be embedded into any C++ application.
